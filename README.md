# UX

### User Experience

## As a new visitor who comes straight from any social media profile of the artist and has not heard any music yet:

1. I want to find the artists music. 

2. I want to understand the layout and reason for the sites functions without having to focus too much.

3. I want to be able hear a sample of any song before I go to another platform to stream the full song.

## As a visitor who comes from an ad campaign for a specific song: 

1. I want to be able to see that I landed on the right song.

2. I want to understand the layout and reason for the sites functions without having to focus too much.

3. I want to be able to find my streaming platform, to play the song from there. 

## As a visitor who really likes the artist: 

1. I want to be able to connect with the artist. 

2. I would like to be able to get a notification from the artist when there is something new going on. 

3. I would like the esthetics of the artists website to match the artists sound and brand.

# Deployment

This website was published using GitHub Pages. 

On Github, and on the specific repository for this page, there is a settings button.
Further down on that page is Github Pages section. 
I selected the Master branch instead of None and saved it. Site went live.
The link was made using the repository name as a part of it.
